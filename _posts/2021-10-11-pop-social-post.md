Joined [Pop Social Inc.](https://popsocial.app) as a backend engineer intern earlier this year in May (2021), and worked on several backend projects including research and backend design for a scalable search service, automating tests, documentation and new service creation. Increased code test coverage, with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/), by ~70% across all backend services! Converted core services to TypeScript.

In August, after my internship officially ended, I joined Pop as a backend engineer! Since then, I've created and maintained our new [real-time meet-ups service](https://www.instagram.com/p/CTr51PglVO2/), built to scale beyond 500 daily active users. Most recently, I'm working on our new friends network system backed by a [graph database](https://neo4j.com/) and efficient backend queries.
