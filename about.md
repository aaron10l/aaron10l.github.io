Thanks for looking at my personal website! I am an undergraduate [Computer Science](https://ceas.uc.edu/academics/departments/computer-science.html) student from Houston, TX studying at the University of Cincinnati. Check out my first [publication](https://joss.theoj.org)!

Most recently, I was a software engineer intern at the [Chan Zuckerberg Biohub](https://www.elevancehealth.com/) in SF (obligatory blog post coming soon...).

I am interested in distributed systems, backend development, and machine learning. Lately, I have been learning Go and working on some interesting web apps for the housing market...

Outside of class, I enjoy listening to live music, hitting the gym, and fishin' missions.

My favorite quote:

> Sometimes itâ€™s the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.
