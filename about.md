I'm a sophomore [Computer Science](https://ceas.uc.edu/academics/departments/computer-science.html) undergraduate student from Houston, TX studying at the University of Cincinnati. I'm currently an Undergraduate Researcher with the Kellis lab at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology.

Most recently, I was a software engineer intern at [Elevance Health](https://www.elevancehealth.com/) on the AI/ML team, and prior to that, a software engineer at [Millspaw Electronics.](https://millspawelectronics.com).

I am interested in machine learning, financial technology, and bioinformatics. I participated in Susquehanna International Group's discovery day, where I learned about algorithmic trading.

Outside of class, I enjoy listening to music, hitting the gym, and fishing.

My favorite quote:

> Sometimes itâ€™s the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.
