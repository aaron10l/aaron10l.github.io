I'm a [Computer Science](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/academics/graduate/masters-in-cse/) Undergraduate student from Houston, TX studying at the University of Cincinnati. I'm currently an Undergraduate Researcher with the Kellis lab at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology.

Most recently, I was a software engineer intern at Elevance Health on the AI/ML team, and prior to that, a software engineer at [Millspaw Electronics.](https://millspawelectronics.com).

I was a SIG Discovery Day participant at Susquehanna International Group!

I am interested in machine learning, financial technology, and bioinformatics.

Outside of class, I enjoy listening to music, hitting the gym, and fishing.

My favorite quote:

> Sometimes itâ€™s the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.
