I'm a [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/academics/graduate/masters-in-cse/) Master's student from Singapore studying at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I'm currently a Graduate Student Instructor for [EECS 376: Foundations of Computer Science](https://eecs376.org/).

Most recently, I was a software engineer intern at Google on the Chrome Intelligence team, and prior to that, a backend engineer at [Pop Social Inc.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pop-social-life/id1460938657), and a software engineer intern at [Benefitfocus](https:benefitfocus.com).

I was a Spring 2021 Major League Hacking (MLH) [Open Source Fellow](https://fellowship.mlh.io/programs/open-source) with Facebook WebXR!

Outside of class, I'm currently an [MHacks 2023](https://mhacks.org) Core Team member in the development team, and have been involved in the [Future of Programming Lab](https://www.notion.so/Future-of-Programming-Lab-241d162461a04064ae1fd9ae32bf4cb1) working on [Hazel](https://hazel.org/), a [GitHub Campus Expert](https://githubcampus.expert/zhixiangteoh/), and was previously a team member at [UMich Google DSC](https://www.umichdsc.org/team.html) and [IEEE](https://ieee.eecs.umich.edu/index.html).

My favorite quote, that also sums up how I feel about open source software:

> If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.
